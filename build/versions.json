    "description": "Version 3.1 Beta introduces a polished user interface and multiple refinements to the gameplay loop. It is the first ever Beta version, a milestone on the course of game development and marketing. It will be the first time our customers see our product. \n\n However, due to lack of funds, this version will only be released at small scale among our fans, and each user must produce the game itself from digital version in order to reduce an ~$2000 printing and transportation cost."

This alpha focuses on establishing stable game rules and internal data models.\n\nNotes for playtesters: expect rough edges in the user interface. The Alpha stage is primarily for testing core balance and identifying critical bugs before wider beta testing. \n\n Though developed earlier than Beta 3.1, this version will be tested simultaneously with Beta 3.1 version."

    "description": "Version 2.0 Alpha introduces significant changes to the core mechanics of Formula Champion, including a completely new gameplay mechanism, entirely refactored rule description and UI, introducing the 'delta' mechanism which turned the players' focus from pure racing to strategic resource management, also contributing to today's brand 'Delta Dash'."

    "description": "Version 1.1 Alpha was an ultra-realistic version of 1.0 including realistic gear-shift data sheet, re-designed track for better data resolution, and refined UI using F1 font. However, its complexity made it almost unplayable without the developer as host and easy to crash, this version, though said 'better than 1.0', was still horrible as a product and not ready for publish."

    "brief": "The first ever version, inspired by ChatGPT. It is simple but no fun at all.",
    "description": "Version 1.0 Alpha was the first ever version of this series, with a very coarse track and control system inspired by ChatGPT. It featured the most basic racing mechanism: control car speed, take steps on track forward, and not running too fast in the corners. The UI was also very coarse, as there was no driver panel and all control were memorized by the players and resources were represented by solid cards. However, its multi-lap strategy system and ineffective UI made the game extremely slow, and thus a failed project with no likes at all."
